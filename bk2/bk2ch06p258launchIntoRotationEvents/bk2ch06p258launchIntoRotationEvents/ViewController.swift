I can think of various ways we can wind up launching into landscape:

* We accept any orientation, but the device happens to be in landscape at launch time

* The app (.plist) accepts only landscape

* The app (.plist) accepts any orientation, but landscape is first

* The app accepts any orientation, but the view controller restricts it to landscape

 same as previous!
 
 === app accepts any, but landscape is first, but device is held in portrait
 
 same as first
 
 ==== app accepts any, but view controller wants landscape
 
 aha. Well, it depends. If the device is held in landscape, just like other landscape cases
 
 but if the device is held in portrait, launch into portrait and rotate, it's like iOS 10:
 NB iOS 13 still looks like this except no trait collection did change either
 
 viewDidLoad
 viewDidLoad reports (320.0, 568.0)
 viewDidLoad reports compact regular
 will appear (320.0, 568.0) // proving that will appear can be too early for layout-related
 willTransition trait compact compact
 trait collection did change to compact compact
 NO SIZE CHANGE NOTIFICATION
 willLayout  (568.0, 320.0)
 didLayout (568.0, 320.0)
 did appear (568.0, 320.0)
 
 but on iPad, there is no willTransition, because we did not change

/*
 
 iOS 10:

=== normal launch into portrait:

viewDidLoad, portrait view, portrait trait collection
(will appear)
trait collection did change
(willLayout)
(didLayout)
(did appear)

=== normal launch with device at landscape: NB this happens regardless of order in info plist!
[basically the rule seems to be if app can launch into portrait, it will]

viewDidLoad, portrait view, portrait trait collection
trait collection did change (and the others)
[visible rotation]
will transition to landscape
will transition to landscape view size
trait collection did change
did/will layout

=== app accepts only landscape:

viewDidLoad, landscape view, landscape trait collection
(will appear)
trait collection did change (and the others)
=> so, in this case, we do not start with portrait and then rotate!

=== app accepts any, but landscape is first, but device is held in portrait:
[New: just like the first case! we launch into portrait and stay there]

=== app accepts any, portrait or landscape is first (!), but view controller is landscape only, device is held in portrait or landscape:

viewDidLoad, portrait view, portrait trait
(will appear)
will transition to landscape trait collection
NO SIZE CHANGE NOTIFICATION
trait collection did change
(layout, did appear)
[and if the app then rotates 180 degrees]
will transition to same landscape size


*/

/* 
If we are in, say, navigation interface,
we do not have actual view dimensions until "will appear"
*/

/*
In navigation interface, we can get did layout more than once on rotation...
...and dimensions are not necessarily correct the first time
layout on rotation in that case is *after* the transitions/trait changes
*/

/*
I took out the navigation interface because it confuses the matter for now;
for example, we can launch into portrait even if the navigation controller delegate says no
