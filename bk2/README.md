These are the **complete downloadable code examples** for my books, _iOS 13 Programming Fundamentals With Swift_ (<http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920310068.do>) and _Programming iOS 13_ (<http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920310075.do>).

Examples have been revised for Xcode 11, Swift 5.1, and iOS 13.

If you find these examples helpful and you haven't purchased the books, please consider doing so.

The downloadable code for previous editions has been moved off to subfolders "iOS12bookExamples", "iOS11bookExamples", "iOS10bookExamples", "iOS9bookExamples", "iOS8bookExamples" and "iOS7bookExamples". The code for the earlier editions has been removed.
